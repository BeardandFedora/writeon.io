							<h2>My First Successful Dreamline</h2>
							<small class="muted">Posted: 10/11/2013</small>
							<p>Along the way, I heard a few different reactions to the cross country road trip I took from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tacoma, Washington ranging from “It must be nice to be rich” to “you must have saved up for a long time”, neither of which were true. I’m going to share with you how I was able to travel 4900 miles over a four-week span, visiting 18 cities in 10 different states.</p>
							<p>About 8 months ago, I read a book called <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/" title="The 4-Hour Work Week">The 4-Hour Work Week</a> (4HWW) by <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog" title="Tim Ferris">Tim Ferris</a>. The book focuses on lifestyle design and uses a formula to be able to live the life that you want. The formula can be summed up in the following acronym: DEAL. Definition, Elimination, Automation and Liberation. Here’s how I used Definition, Elimination and Liberation to make this road trip happen and how I discovered an idea for a muse (Automation) along the way.</p>

								<small>I was excited to reach Tallahassee since this would be the first time I had ever <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org" title="CouchSurfing">CouchSurf</a>’d. I was staying with <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/people/strangepowers/" title="Chris and Meagan (StrangePowers)">Chris & Meagan</a> and wasn’t quite sure what to expect. Most likely a cool couple offering a coach for me to rest my head on and an hour or two of good conversation. My only concern was that they’d be unhappy with the fact that my arrival time was a few hours later than I expected, but with open communication between Chris and I along the way, things worked out just fine.</small>

								<small class="muted">Visited: 9/10/2013 (2 nights)</small>
								<small class="muted">Posted: 10/21/2013</small>
								<small>I was excited to reach New Orleans for multiple reasons; It's New Orleans, it was my first time in a hostel and I had a list of recommended places to visit from my father and people that I've encountered that are from Nola.</small>
								<small>As I pulled into town, my first stop was to check into the <a href="http://www.indiahousehostel.com/" title="India House Hostel">India House Hostel</a> which is located on Canal and South Lopez Street. It was a series of houses that were purchased shortly after Katrina and converted into a hostel. The atmosphere was fantastically eclectic and welcoming.</small>

It would be the furthest I had ever traveled west and in all honesty, I wasn&rsquo;t even sure of the geographical order of the cities I would be visiting in Texas. For example, I had told my father as I was leaving Nola that I&rsquo;d be in Austin that night. That was not the case. After looking at my itinerary, I was going to <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/" title="CouchSurfing">CouchSurf</a> with a guy named <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/abhijit.mohod/" title="Abhijit">Abhijit</a>.</small>

								<small class="muted">Visited: 9/13/2013 (1 night)</small>

								<small>I needed to find an alternative to <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/" title="CouchSurfing">CouchSurfing</a> for lodging in Austin. My search for a host had left me without a place to stay. I was searching for hostels until <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/abhijit.mohod/">Abhi</a>, my CouchSurfing host in <a href="http://blog.tylergoelz.com/post/64810203129/houston-texas-hidden-underground-tunnels-and-the-beginni">Houston</a>, mentioned a website called <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">AirBnB</a>. I had never heard of the website before, but was up for the new experience. AirBnB is basically the same concept of CouchSurfing, but with cost associated with your stay. I found a place to stay that was only a few blocks from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Street_(Austin,_Texas)">East 6th Street</a> with a guy named <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/70342">Nick</a> and his roommates.</small>

								<small class="muted">Visited: 9/14/2013 (1 night)</small>
								<small class="muted">Posted: 10/28/2013</small>
								<small>I originally planned to stay in Dallas for my last night in Texas, since I wanted to visit "The Big 3" cities I had heard of. I kept hearing the same things about Dallas from the Texans I stayed with, "It's pretentious", "It's like the L.A. of Texas", "There are a lot of $30k millionaire douche bags". Fortunately, I received a message on <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/" title="CouchSurfing">CouchSurfing</a> from <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/people/bradwilsonem/" title="Brad">Brad</a> who was offering an extra room in his apartment. He mentioned it would be a great weekend to visit since him and his wife, <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/people/marybethwilson/" title="Marybeth">Marybeth</a> would be brewing beer. I was sold.</small>

								<small>By this point, I was quite comfortable with the way <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/" title="CouchSurfing">CouchSurfing</a> works. You connect with a local from a city you will be visiting, meet them when you arrive, grab dinner & a few drink and enjoy the city like the locals do. This was not the case in Oklahoma City.</small>

I received an eager message from Eddy about a week before my stay talking about his passion for technology, good food and a decent beer selection; all things good. I was instantly excited to meet him and his family.</small>

								<small>Ever since Kimmi, my girlfriend, went to Vegas when she was 21, she had always told me she would love to go back. Who wouldn’t love to go to Vegas?! I know I was super excited about it, especially since it was my first time in Sin City. To give you an idea of how stoked we were, we drove straight from Denver to Las Vegas totally skipping our layover town in Utah. For any of you that haven’t driven from Denver to Vegas, it takes about eleven hours IF you don’t stop, but it was decided, the adrenaline had taken over and we weren’t stopping until we saw Vegas, baby!</small>

								<small>It has been said, &ldquo;...you can't have a rainbow, without a little rain&rdquo;, well Paso Robles was the lull of the trip. After Kimmi and I drove 13 hours from <a href="http://blog.tylergoelz.com/post/66043300759/denver-colorado-the-girl-the-pioneer-and-red-rocks-amphi" title="Denver, Colorado: The Girl, The Pioneer and Red Rocks Amphitheatre">Denver</a> to <a href="http://blog.tylergoelz.com/post/66243902496/las-vegas-nevada-part-1-raphael-rivera-canadians-new-yor" title="Las Vegas, Nevada: Part 1 - Raphael Rivera, Canadians &amp; New York, New York">Las Vegas</a>, we were not up for the extensive drive from Las Vegas to Napa Valley. Especially since we had our hearts set on taking Highway 1 once we hit the coast of California, which would add on a considerable amount of time to our drive. Our goal was to make it as close to the California coast as we could before stopping for the night. Paso Robles just happened to be our final destination for the night.</small>

We booked a room at the <a href="http://www.napavalleyhotelandsuites.com/index.html" title="Napa Valley Hotel &amp; Suites">Napa Valley Hotel &amp; Suites</a> and were on our way.

								<small class="muted">Posted: 11/18/2013</small>
								<small>Kimmi and I had a couple reasons to be excited to visit San Francisco; The forward-thinking mindset of the city was intriguing and we were staying in the famous Castro district known for it’s gay population with Kimmi’s co-worker Jack and his partner Joe. Jack and Joe visit San Francisco annually and the timing of the trip was primarily based around when they would be in the city. Everything from the date I left St. Pete to how many nights I spent in each city to when Kimmi flew into Denver and out of California was based around the fact that Jack, Joe, Kimmi and I would meet in San Francisco on September 24th.</small>

								<small>Sacramento was one of those cities where I had no set expectations of what the city would offer. I chose to visit because it was California&rsquo;s state capitol and honestly because it was a city I had heard of before. I found a really nice <a href="http://www.norcalhostels.org/sac" title="Sacramento Hostel">hostel</a> that is a Victorian mansion built in 1885 by a Gold Rush millionaire. The most interesting part to me about the hostel the amount of traveling the building has done itself.</small>
