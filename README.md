##The World's Finest Writing Experience
WriteOn is a rich, minimal writing experience that allows you to focus on writing and publish with ease. Start writing at www.writeon.io

###Focus on writing in a rich, yet minimal interface.
We've refined the typical writing interface, stripping away distractions, leaving a simple, yet powerful writing tool allowing writers to focus on the writing. We like to think of WriteOn as a modern-day typewriter.

###Publish with ease to popular online platforms.
Publish to Blogger, GitHub, Gist, Tumblr, and WordPress or upload to Google Drive and Dropbox straight through WriteOn. Publish in markdown, HTML, or through a custom template using our templating engine. All directly through WriteOn.

Writing and Publishing is just the tip of the iceberg. WriteOn also has features like collaboration, commenting, and writing offline. [See all of WriteOn's feature](http://writeon.io/#/features)

>Jack Kerouac typed On the Road on a single roll of paper so he would not be interrupted. Ernest Hemingway wrote standing up. J.R.R. Tolkien liked to write from his attic and even stated in his foreword to Lord of the Rings that “the cost of professional typing by the ten-fingered was beyond [his] means.”
